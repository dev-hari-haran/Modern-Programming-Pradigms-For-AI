# 📊 Data Science Mastery: Python & R

Welcome to the ultimate repository for **Data Analytics and Science**. This project serves as a comprehensive roadmap—from the fundamental syntax of Python and R to building production-ready interactive dashboards.

---

## 🚀 Repository Overview

This repo is designed to bridge the gap between basic coding and end-to-end data workflows. Whether you're mastering **Vectorization** in NumPy or deploying a **Shiny** app, you'll find structured code and practical examples here.

### 🐍 Python Ecosystem

* **Core Basics:** Syntax, Data Structures, and File Handling.
* **Numerical Computing:** Deep dive into `NumPy`—Vectorization and Broadcasting.
* **Data Manipulation:** Advanced `Pandas` techniques (Cleaning, Grouping, Transformations).
* **Visualization:** Aesthetic storytelling with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.

### 📉 R Programming & Stats

* **R Fundamentals:** Vectors, Data Frames, and Functional Programming.
* **The Tidyverse:** Efficient manipulation using `DPLyr`.
* **Visual Grammar:** High-quality plotting with `Ggplot2`.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis testing and dataset analytics.

### 🛠️ Workflows & Deployment

* **End-to-End Analytics:** Full lifecycle from raw data to insights.
* **Interactive Dashboards:**
* **Streamlit** (Python)
* **Shiny** (R)
